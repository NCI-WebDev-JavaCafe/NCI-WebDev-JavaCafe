          <h3 class="text-center">How It All Began</h3>
          <p>Our story began when 2 college friends reunited to tackle a challenging web development project.
            In between coding sessions and project deadlines, we found ourselves gathering around coffee. It was more than a drink; it was fuel for our ideas, a reason to come together, and a small escape from the stress of college life. Every sip seemed to spark a new idea or provide a moment of clarity, making us realize that coffee was the heart of our journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we graduated and went our separate ways, the idea lingered. A few years later, we decided it was time to turn this passion into reality. Our goal was simple yet ambitious: to create a space where others could find the same inspiration and comfort we found in a great cup of coffee. We wanted to craft a café experience that felt welcoming and authentic, a place where every visitor could feel at home, whether they were working on a project, meeting up with friends, or simply enjoying a quiet moment alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, our café isn’t just a business; it’s a place that embodies our story and our journey. Each cup served is a reminder of the long nights, the big dreams, and the friendships that made it all possible. We’re here to share that journey with you, one cup at a time.
